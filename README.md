To successfully compile the project you will need to download threejs from https://threejs.org/, click the download link on the left and put the folder into the threejsgame folder under the name
of "three.js-master".

Then use a terminal or powershell in the threejsgame folder and run ```python -m http.server``` then navigate to your browser and type localhost:8000 to view the project.

It's worth noting that the project runs alot smoother in Firefox as opposed to Chrome for my PC.
